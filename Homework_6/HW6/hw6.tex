\begin{problem}{1}
Let $X$ be the total from rolling 6 fair dice, and let $X_1,...,X_6$ be the individual rolls. What is $P(X=18)$?
\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
The generating function of $X_i~~(i=1,2,\cdots,6)$ is
\[
g_{X_i}(z)=\frac{1}{6}z+\frac{1}{6}z^2+\frac{1}{6}z^3+\frac{1}{6}z^4+\frac{1}{6}z^5+\frac{1}{6}z^6=\frac{z}{6}(1+z+z^2+z^3+z^4+z^5+z^6)~~(i=1,2,\cdots,6)
\]
Then the generating function of $X=\sum_{i=1}^{6}X_i$ is
\[
g_X(z)=\prod_{i=1}^6g_{X_i}(z)=\frac{z^6}{6^6}(1+z+z^2+z^3+z^4+z^5)^6=\frac{z^6}{6^6}(\frac{1-z^6}{1-z})^6
\]
where
\[
(1-t^6)^6=\sum_{j=0}^6\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\j\end{array}\right)(-1)^jz^{6j}
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{(1-z)^6}=(1+z+z^2+\cdots)^6=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_kz^k
\]
Here, $a_k$ is the number of lists (``list'' means order matters) consisting of six independent non-negative integer which add to $k$. We can also regard $a_k$ as the number of cases in which $k$ balls in a line are separated by five boards, so
\[
a_k=\left(\begin{array}{c}k+5\\5\end{array}\right)
\]
So
\[
\frac{1}{(1-z)^6}=(1+z+z^2+\cdots)^6=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}k+5\\5\end{array}\right)z^k
\]
and
\[
g_X(z)=\frac{z^6}{6^6}\left[\sum_{j=0}^6\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\j\end{array}\right)(-1)^jz^{6j}\right]\left[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}k+5\\5\end{array}\right)z^k\right]
\]
In the generating function above, the coefficient of $z^{18}$ item is
\[
\frac{1}{6^6}\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}17\\5\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}11\\5\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\2\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}5\\5\end{array}\right)\right]=\frac{3431}{6^6}\approx0.07354

\begin{problem}{2} 
Find the MGF of $X\sim Unif(a,b)$ and $Y\sim Expo(\lambda)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
The PDF of $X$ is
\[
f_X(x)=\frac{1}{b-a},~~x\in(a,b)
\]
The MGF of $X$ is
\[
M_X(t)=\int_{a}^{b}e^{-tx}f_X(x)dx=\frac{e^{-at}-e^{-bt}}{(b-a)t}
\]
The PDF of $Y$ is
\[
f_Y(y)=\lambda e^{-\lambda y},~~x\geq0
\]
The MGF of $Y$ is
\[
M_Y(t)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-tx}f_Y(y)dy=\frac{\lambda}{t+\lambda}
\]
\end{sol}

\begin{problem}{3}
Find the MGF of $X\sim Bern(p)$ and $Y\sim Bin(n,p)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
The PMF of $X$ is
\[
P_X(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
p,&\text{ if }x=1\\
1-p,&\text{ if }x=0
\end{array}\right.
\]
The MGF of $X$ is
\[
M_X(t)=(1-p)+pe^{-t}
\]
The MGF of $Y$ is
\[
M_Y(t)=[M_X(t)]^n=[(1-p)+pe^{-t}]^n
\]
\end{sol}

\begin{problem}{4}
Consider a setting where a Poisson approximation should work well: let $A_1,...,A_n$ be independent, rare events, with $n$ large and $p_j=P(A_j)$ small for all $j$. Let $X=I(A_1)+\cdots+I(A_n)$ count how many of the rare events occur, and Let $\lambda = E(X)$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a).] Find the MGF of $X$.
    \item[(b).] If the approximation $1+x\approx e^x$ (this is a good approximation when $x$ is very close to $0$ but terrible when $x$ is not close to $0$) is used to write each factor in the MGF of $X$ as $e$ to a power.What happens to the MGF? 
    (Hint: if $Y\sim Pois(\lambda)$, then $M_Y=e^{(e^t-1)\lambda}$)
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
\\(a) The MGF of $X$ is
\begin{align*}
M_X(t)=&\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}e^{-\lambda}e^{kt}\\
=&e^{-\lambda}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(\lambda e^t)^k}{k!}\\
=&e^{-\lambda}e^{\lambda e^t}=e^{\lambda(e^t-1)}
\end{align*}
(b) If the approximation $1+x\approx e^x$ works, the MGF of $x$ is
\[
M_X(t)=e^{\lambda t}
\]
\end{sol}

\begin{problem}{5}
Suppose $X\sim Bin(n,p)$.
By using Binomial PGF, find the expectation $E(X)$ and variance $Var(X)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{sol}
According to the definition, the PGF of a Bernoulli distributed random variable is
\[
G_{X_i}(z)=(1-p)+pz
\]
The PGF of $X$ is
\[
G_{X}(z)=G_{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}(z)=\prod_{i=1}^nG_{X_i}{z}=[(1-p)+pz]^n
\]
Then
\begin{align*}
G_X'(z)=&np[(1-p)+pz]^{n-1}\\
G_X''(z)=&n(n-1)p^2[(1-p)+pz]^{n-2}
\end{align*}
The expectation is
\[
E(X)=G'(1)=np
\]
The variance is
\[
Var(X)=G''(1)+G'(1)-[G'(1)]^2=n(n-1)p^2+np-(np)^2=np(1-p)
\]
